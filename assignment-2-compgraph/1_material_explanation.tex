\section{Introduction}

This assignment focuses on implementing a \textbf{Halfedge Mesh data structure} and several \textbf{mesh subdivision algorithms}, which are fundamental techniques in computer graphics for representing and refining polygonal surfaces.  
Unlike simple vertex-face lists, the halfedge representation explicitly encodes mesh connectivity, making it efficient to traverse adjacency relationships (vertices, edges, and faces).  

On top of this structure, students will implement several algorithms such as \textbf{Linear Subdivision}, \textbf{Triangulation}, \textbf{Loop Subdivision}, and \textbf{Catmull--Clark Subdivision}, enabling the conversion of coarse polygonal models into smoother and more detailed meshes.  
Through this assignment, you will gain a deeper understanding of mesh topology, geometry processing, and the foundations of modern surface modeling.
