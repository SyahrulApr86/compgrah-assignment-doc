\subsection{Testing and Validation}

Two meshes are provided for validation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Default Cube} – appears automatically when the program is launched
    \item \texttt{simple\_pyramid.obj} – a low-poly pyramid included in the \texttt{meshes} folder
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Validation Procedure:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Load either the default cube or \texttt{simple\_pyramid.obj}.
    \item Apply \textbf{Linear Subdivision} and confirm each face is split into smaller faces.
    \item Apply \textbf{Triangulate} and verify all faces become triangles.
    \item Apply \textbf{Loop Subdivision} (only valid on fully triangular meshes) and observe the increase in smoothness.
    \item Apply \textbf{Catmull--Clark Subdivision} and verify quads are generated consistently.
    \item Compare mesh statistics (vertex count, face count, edge count) before and after each operation using the \texttt{statistics()} function.
\end{enumerate}

Correctness should be verified both visually (mesh smoothness, quad/triangle structure) and numerically (surface area, volume consistency).
