\subsection{What is Halfedge Mesh?}

A halfedge mesh is a data structure used to represent polygonal meshes in computer graphics and geometry processing. 
Unlike simple adjacency lists or winged-edge representations, the halfedge structure explicitly encodes connectivity 
by splitting each edge into two oppositely directed halfedges.
