\section{Introduction}

This assignment focuses on implementing a \textbf{2D SVG software rasterizer}, which is a fundamental computer graphics system that converts vector graphics into pixel images. Unlike hardware-accelerated rendering (GPU-based), software rasterization is performed entirely on the CPU, giving you direct control over every pixel and a deep understanding of the rendering pipeline.
