\subsection{Application Usage}

Students are expected to implement a 2D SVG software rasterizer with interactive GUI capabilities. The application should provide the following functionality:

\textbf{Command Line Interface:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Run with single SVG file: \texttt{python draw\_svg.py filename.svg}
    \item Run with directory: \texttt{python draw\_svg.py svg/directory\_name}
    \item Run without arguments to use GUI file dialogs
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Interactive Controls:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item File loading via GUI dialogs (single file or entire directory)
    \item Navigation between multiple SVG files using Previous/Next buttons
    \item Sample rate adjustment (1x, 2x, 3x anti-aliasing)
    \item Viewport manipulation (pan with mouse drag, zoom with mouse wheel)
\end{itemize}
